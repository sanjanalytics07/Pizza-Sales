# Pizza Sales Analysis
The purpose of doing this project was to analyse the Sales of Pizzas of a Pizza Company/ outlet
so as to learn and improve its Sales Revenue and operations efficiency.
Multiple SQL queries have been executed using MySQL to answer business questions

• The Orders table contains the date & time that all table orders were placed

• The Order Details table contains the different pizzas served with each order in the Orders table, and their quantities

• The Pizzas table contains the size and price for each distinct pizza in the Order Details table, as well as its broader pizza type

• The Pizza Types table contains details on the pizza types in the Pizzas table, including their name as it appears on the menu, the category it falls under, and its list of ingredients
